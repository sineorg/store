## 🛒 Store
This is the official marketplace of Sine for installing mods, themes, and JS.

## 🗒️ Watchlist
We care about our mods and developers, so we dedicate a portion of our time towards helping other developers out by fixing issues with their mods for them. Here are some that we are eyeing for when we get time:
- [Floaty UI](https://github.com/moktavizen/floaty-ui) (Floaty UI for Zen's compact mode, has some visual bugs).
- [Advanced Tab Groups](https://github.com/Vertex-Mods/Advanced-Tab-Groups) (Advanced tab groups for Zen, has some bugs and needs refactoring).
- [Zen Library](https://github.com/Vertex-Mods/Zen-Library) (Needs more feature implementation).

*As we review every mod, we will add more to this list.*
